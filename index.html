        <h1>Nebula (Lightning's Stance)</h1>
        <img src="images/nebula.jpg">
        <p>The most common stance on who caused the snap is Star-Lord, however, there is one who I believe that could have prevented Star-Lord's actions, and would've gotten the glove off. That person being: Nebula.</p>
        <p>There were only two people that were not contributing to Strange and Stark's plan to remove the glove. Those being: Star-Lord and Nebula. Both had freedom to move and do what they want. Mantis was keeping Thanos sedated, while Strange was keeping the Chains of Vishanti on his right arm, while Spider-Man and Iron Man were pulling the Infinity Glove off his left. Star-Lord and Nebula, however, were free to do as they wish. Star-Lord wanted to know the location of Gamora, and while he let his anger get the better of his judgment, and break Thanos out of Mantis's trance, Nebula was also there and did not do anything.</p>
        <p>Nebula was acknowledged in that scene, as she answered Star-Lord's question and said that Thanos and Gamora went to Vormir, and that only Thanos returned with the stone. Thus, Star-Lord became rightfully enraged, but he did not immediately hit Thanos. He started yelling "Tell me she's lying." This gave time for Nebula to act, but she didn't. The entire time that Star-Lord was yelling and screaming at Star-Lord, she could have stopped him. She could have held him back, she could have knocked him out, and heck, she's robotic so she probably had some sort of taser in her to subdue him. Instead, she stood there and mourned, while not focusing on the larger task at hand, and put the whole universe at risk. Mourning comes later, but she was not ignorant of Star-Lord's actions, and thus her inaction enabled Star-Lord's actions, which eventually led to Thanos getting the Time Stone, then the Soul Stone, and finally allow the snap to happen and half of existence disappear in a blip.</p>
