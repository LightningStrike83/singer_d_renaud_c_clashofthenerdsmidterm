        <p>The most common stance on who caused the snap is Star-Lord, however, there is one who I believe that could have prevented Star-Lord's actions, and would've gotten the glove off. That person being: Nebula.</p>
        <p>There were only two people that were not contributing to Strange and Stark's plan to remove the glove. Those being: Star-Lord and Nebula. Both had freedom to move and do what they want. Mantis was keeping Thanos sedated, while Strange was keeping the Chains of Vishanti on his right arm, while Spider-Man and Iron Man were pulling the Infinity Glove off his left. Star-Lord and Nebula, however, were free to do as they wish. Star-Lord wanted to know the location of Gamora, and while he let his anger get the better of his judgment, and break Thanos out of Mantis's trance, Nebula was also there and did not do anything.</p>
        <p>Star Lord was acknowledged in that scene, as she answered Star-Lord's question and said that Thanos and Gamora went to Vormir, and that only Thanos returned with the stone. Thus, Star-Lord became rightfully enraged, but he did not immediately hit Thanos. He started yelling "Tell me she's lying." This gave time for Nebula to act, but she didn't. The entire time that Star-Lord was yelling and screaming at Star-Lord, she could have stopped him. She could have held him back, she could have knocked him out, and heck, she's robotic so she probably had some sort of taser in her to subdue him. Instead, she stood there and mourned, while not focusing on the larger task at hand, and put the whole universe at risk. Mourning comes later, but she was not ignorant of Star-Lord's actions, and thus her inaction enabled Star-Lord's actions, which eventually led to Thanos getting the Time Stone, then the Soul Stone, and finally allow the snap to happen and half of existence disappear in a blip.</p>

        <p>I hate to be the basic one here, but I firmly believe that Star Lord was the cause of the snap. Sure, Nebula had her hands free, but at the same time, Thanos was also her adoptive father. As shown earlier in the film when Gamora was taken to Vormir for Thanos to obtain the soul stone, she never wanted to fight Thanos. Nebula would likely have been in a similar boat, since Thanos did raise her as one of his own, even if he was a bit of a deadbeat.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I should mention, STAR LORD WAS THE ONE THAT PUNCHED HIM IN THE F$%KING FACE. (takes deep breath). My bad, I got a lil' heated there. Okay, deep breaths. The gauntlet was almost off Thanos' hand, had Star lord done nothing, they could have taken the gauntlet off, and Strange could have simply magic'd his way out of there like he does.</p>
        <p>Henceforth, it should be known that while Nebula wasn't all that helpful in the fight against Thanos, Star lord was ultimately the one that intervened to the point of causing the destruction of half the universe.</p>
